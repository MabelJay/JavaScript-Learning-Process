1. array definition:
  var array_name = [];
  
2. get array value: array_name[index];

3. untyped:
   the elements in an array could be number, string, boolean,eg: var fishTank = ['glass', 10, true];
   
4. methods: 
    [].pop();    // remove an item from the end of the array
    [].push();   // add an item from the end of the array
    [].shift;    // remove an item from the front of the array
    [].unshift;  // add an item from the front of the array
    array.concat(array); //unites two arrays
    array.reverse();
    array.sort();
    array.slice(); //this method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object.

11. keywords(this & bind):
    sample:
      let cat = {
        sound: 'meow',
        speak: function(){
          console.log(this.sound);
        }
      };
      speakFunction = cat.speak;
      speakFunction(); //undefined
   solution:
      speakFunction = cat.speak;
      speakFunctionBind = speakFunction.bind(cat);
      speakFunctionBind();  //'meow'
     
12. keywords(this & call):
    var person = {
      firstName: 'Jane'
    }
    var hello = function(greeting){
      console.log(greeting+" "+this.firstName);
    }      
    
    hello("hello"); //hello undefined
  solution:
    hello.call(person, "hello");  //hello Jane
